        "JavaScript is one of the most popular and versatile languages, born in 1995 to provide interactivity to web pages, but today it is used for almost anything, from web development to artificial intelligence. It is the only language that browsers understand natively, it has a fast learning curve and is in high demand in the job market due to its multiple applications.",
        "In JavaScript, fundamental data types include Number, which represents any number, whether integer or decimal; String, which is used for text and is placed in quotes; Boolean, which can only be true or false; Null, indicating the absence of value; Undefined, which indicates that a variable has been declared but has no value assigned; Symbol, a special type for creating unique identifiers; and BigInt, which allows handling very large numbers. These types are essential for managing information in programming.",
        "The console.log() function in JavaScript is used to print messages to the browser or code editor console, being very useful for debugging and checking the value of variables during development. To use it, simply write console.log() followed by the message or variable you want to display in parentheses. In addition to console.log(), there are other methods such as console.error(), console.warn() and console.info(), which allow printing error, warning and information messages, respectively, making it easier to identify different types of messages on the console."
